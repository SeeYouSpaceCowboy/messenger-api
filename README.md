## Getting Started with Messenger
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites
Things you need to install beforehand:
* **Bundler** - Rails package manager

### Installing

Open terminal and run the following lines of code to clone and run this project.

 ```shell

### Installing the Front-end
